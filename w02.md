# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Brief introduction to Operating Systems Security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-security/)<br>
This article is basically a summarization of whats in Silberschatz's chapter 16, with a little addition on its substance. The content/materials are displayed in points, with each points has short and easy-to-understand definitions.

2. [Network Attacks and Network Security Threats](https://www.cynet.com/network-attacks/network-attacks-and-network-security-threats/)<br>
This was actually an advertisement for Cynet, a product that offers protection in network-level security system/environment. Although the ads' purpose was obviously to sell the products, but the article also offers a good & comprehensive explanation on what are the possible threats available in network-level security & what steps of measurement should be taken in order to prevent the attacks/threats or to minimize the effects.

3. [Types of Network Security Attacks](https://blog.eccouncil.org/types-of-network-security-attacks/)<br>
As we may already know, there are several types of network-level security attacks. This blog article by eccounalsocil.org explains on what are the most common types of network-level security attacks, including virus, malware, worm, phishing, DoS, etc.

4. [Terms/Glossary regarding Information Security](https://simplicable.com/new/information-security)<br>
As previously mentioned on last week's top ten, my usual approach upon entering new topic is to familiarize myself with the terms related/within the topic. This website provides a glossary of terms related to the topic of Information Security, while it isn't particularly titled terms regarding OS/Network Security, but it also has some definitions of terms that intersect between those two titles.

5. [Cryptography Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o)<br>
A crash course explaining the topic Cryptography. This video is served in a rather refreshing manner, with the explanation consists of the history of Cryptography, and Cryptography from the perspective of Computer Science & OS/Network security.

6. [What is GnuPG and How do I use it?](https://www.privex.io/articles/what-is-gpg)<br>
This is a very brief article, explaining the differences between public vs private keys, and how to deal with GPG (generate, import, export, encrypt, and decrypt a message).

7. [GnuPG Handbook](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html)<br>
An official documentation for GnuPG. Includes more detailed explanation on the how-to(s), concepts, and usecases of GPG/GnuPG.

8. [Introduction to SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms)](https://brilliant.org/wiki/secure-hashing-algorithms/)<br>
A wikipedia-like page of the subject SHA. According to this page, SHA is a subset of Cryptographic functions which designed to keep data secured. Within the page, there are also mentioned the types of SHA and an explanation to each types.

9. [Differences between SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-256](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256-hash-algorithms/)<br>
This article offers a more detailed and comprehensive explanation on what are the differences between each types of SHA.

10. [A guide to Firewall](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/firewall)<br>
Firewall for me was a term that has been very familiar on my dictionary for ages. I used to play a lot of pirated games (oops :D) back in my elementary and junior high days, an if one wants to install cracked/pirated games on their pc/machine, they first need to disable the firewall on the settings. But then again, I never really know what is Firewall, and what are the uses/functions of firewall up until now. The article provided contains the explanation of what is firewall, how does it work, and what are the types of firewall.
