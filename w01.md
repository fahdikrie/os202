# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [How vim Makes my Daily Life Easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzD2UdQl5Gc) & [A Vid in which Vim Saves Me Hours & Hundreds of Clicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hraHAZ1-RaM)<br>
I actually watched the first video quite some time ago, and i just found about the second video later this week.
In my opinion, these videos may be a good start for me to show what are the capabilities of vim as a text editor.
This is by no means one of them comprehensive tutorials about vim that guarantees the viewer to be able to operate
vim instantly by the end of the video, but i'd say this is still a good start and easy introduction to vim as i previously mentioned.
