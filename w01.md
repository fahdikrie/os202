# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [How vim Makes my Daily Life Easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzD2UdQl5Gc) & [A Vid in which Vim Saves Me Hours & Hundreds of Clicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hraHAZ1-RaM)<br>
I actually watched the first video quite some time ago, and I just found about the second video later this week.
In my opinion, these videos may be a good start for me to show what are the capabilities of vim as a text editor.
This is by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPBl20J22wno means one of them comprehensive tutorials about vim that guarantees the viewer to be able to operate
vim instantly by the end of the video, but i'd say this is still a good start and easy introduction to vim as I previously mentioned.

2. [35 Linux Basic Commands Every User Should Know](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands) or [37 Important Linux Commands You Should Know](https://www.howtogeek.com/412055/37-important-linux-commands-you-should-know/)<br>
These websites provide 30++ basic commands of Linux that can work as a 'cheat-sheet' for users who has little to no experience
on operating Linux.

3. [gawk command in Linux with Examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gawk-command-in-linux-with-examples/)<br>
Earlier this week, Kak Yoga as one of the teaching assistants published some question on SCELE that asks what are the
output of the programs attached. One of the program has gawk commands, which I had no idea what was gawk about. So I did
a little GSGS on what gawk is, and this link showed up on the result.

4. [Regex crash course in 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk)<br>
This video provides a shortcut for those who want to learn regex in a rather simplified way. The content is
more practical than theoritical. Kyle showed the viewer regex examples/usecases through direct hands-on using
what is called regexr (https://regexr.com/).

5. [More comprehensive Regex crash course playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD)<br>
In contrast to the previous regex course by Kyle from Web Dev Simplified, this link redirects to a playlist
from Net Ninja. The playlist consists of 16 videos with each duration ranging from 5 to 7 minutes. While Kyle's course
is a direct hands on of Regex usecases, Net Ninja explains about what is and/or what are the uses of regex at the first
of the series.

6. [What is virtualization?](https://opensource.com/resources/virtualization#:~:text=Virtualization%20is%20the%20process%20of,on%20a%20computer%20system%20simultaneously.)<br>
This is an article that contains a pretty much straightforward of virtualization, including a brief explanation of
the software that accomodates virtualization in a machine, Hypervisor. Also explained on the article, the definition of VM,
and the difference of VM and container.

7. [The 7 Types of Virtualization](https://www.kelsercorp.com/blog/the-7-types-of-virtualization)<br>
If the previous website explains about the general definitions of virtualization, hypervisor, VM, etc.
This website goes deeper within the virtualization, and explains about what are the types available
concerning virtualization.

8. [Virtualization Explained (a guide provided by IBM Cloud Team)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk)<br>
This is video serves a very similar to the opensource.com website mentioned previously. What this video offers more
is that it is way easier to understand through the use of drawings & illustrations.

9. [Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/)<br>
A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter (Parker, 2011).
The link above serves similarly as a 'software documentation' for shell scripts. Strong points of this website, in my opinion,
that it's systematic, intuitive, and super-easy to follow. Oh, and just for information only, this website is built based on
the book Shell Scripting Tutorial by Steve Parker, which I quoted one of the definition from it previously.

10. [Structures of Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXPBl20J22w)<br>
A rather quick 19 minutes video (rather quick considering the topics that are covered) recapping the subject
POK that was taken previously, and then integrating that knowledge to our current topic, Operating System. This
video explained how a lot of components such as kernel, BIOS, etc. when combined together forms a functional
Operating System.
