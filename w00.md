# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [OS-related Glossary](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/os.htm)<br>
My approach on getting into OS concepts & theories was to get familiar with the concepts & terms,
and I found that this website has the most complete list of os-related terms & definitions
among other websites I found from my very limited GSGS. Inside this website, you can find
most of the important terms related to the topic Operating Systems, such as UEFI, BIOS, DOS, Kernel,
Virtualization, etc.

2. [Linuxhardware reddit](https://reddit.com/r/linuxhardware)<br>
For the record, i've been meaning to install linux on my system for quite some time
since the majority of the seniors i've met has linux installed on their system.
So, at the end of the last summer break, i did some GSGS on which linux
distro fits my system/machine best & stable without any meaningful issues, and one
of the GSGS sources i visited the most was r/linuxhardware on reddit.

3. [Askubuntu forum](https://askubuntu.com/)<br>
This has been a great help for me to find how-to(s) and troubleshoot for
most of the problems that I encounter while using Linux.

4. [Arch Linux laptop compatibility index)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/laptop)<br>
One of a (or the) must-see websites if someone wants to install Linux on their machine (especially laptop).
Inside, there are pages for each laptop brands that contains informations and reviews about whether a laptop/series from
that brand can run arch-linux well without any trouble or reviews on how each brand's series perform on arch-linux,
along with the troubleshoot if there's any.

5. [Ubuntu's list of certified machines)](https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop)<br>
This website serves a similar purpose with wiki.archlinux above, the different is certification.ubuntu.com
only shows machines (laptop, pc, desktop, etc) that is supported by Ubuntu, thus, are supposedly
able to run Ubuntu with little to no problem.

6. [How to dual-boot Pop!_OS and Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXZ7_DVxztQ)<br>
I know that there are tons of tutorial about how to dual boot Windows and Linux out there,
but what makes this one special is it is a tutorial specifically meant for Pop!_OS distro
dual boot w/ Windows, and the video also explains how to set up grub bootloader for dual booting.

7. [Switch Windows 10 SATA Config from Intel RST to AHCI](https://support.thinkcritical.com/kb/articles/switch-windows-10-from-raid-ide-to-ahci)<br>
One common issue on dual-booting Windows with Linux (or Pop!_OS distro, for my case) is that the system BIOS
won't detect boot partition for Linux if SATA configuration is being set on Intel RAID/RST. While you
can manually switch between Intel RST to AHCI everytime you want to boot Linux/Windows, but I figure
it wouldn't be much efficient that way. So I looked up on how to set up Windows so that it can boot
using AHCI, and this article is a straightforward help on how to achieve that.

8. [24 things to do after installing Ubuntu](https://fossbytes.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu/)<br>
The moment I finished my Pop!_OS installation, I was delighted upon knowing that I didn't encounter any meaningful
problem during the installation process, but then I didn't really know what to do or what to install first. This website
walked me through on steps that should be followed as an initial setup for Ubuntu. (ie. how to update & upgrade packages,
installing multimedia/codex support, etc)

9. [Set environment variable in Ubuntu](https://mkyong.com/linux/how-to-set-environment-variable-in-ubuntu/)<br>
It was always my intention to use Linux as my main OS for any programming related tasks. Hence, I need to configure
my Ubuntu based Pop!_OS so that it can run programs in many languages (java, python, etc) without problem. As in Windows,
you can set env vars through GUI which already accomodated by Windows (Control Panel > ... > Environment Variables). But sadly,
Pop!_OS (in which it is an ubuntu based distro using GNOME as desktop environment) didn't come with an intuitive GUI that allows
user to set up their env variables. This article helped me on how to set an environment variable in Ubuntu.

10. [How to generate SSH Keys on Ubuntu](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-1804/)<br>
In most of my programming related tasks, each includes the use of git as a version control system. And in the case of using
git, most of them includes the usage of remote version control system, such as gitlab or github. I found it quite troublesome that
github/gitlab asks my username & email everytime i'm using git remote related commands (fetch, push, pull, etc.), then I looked up
the solution, and it says that I need to clone git repo using ssh "link" instead of the regular https. In order to do that, I needed
to link my Linux ssh key to github/gitlab (maybe as a form of authentication? i'm not really sure). This tutorial helped me to
generate ssh key from my Linux OS system.
