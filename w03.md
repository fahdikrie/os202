# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Understanding the Differences Between C#, C++, and C](https://csharp-station.com/understanding-the-differences-between-c-c-and-c/)<br>
Back in my first semester, I was a freshman with no pre-knowledge whatsoever on programming and/or programming languages. The only programming
languages I was familiar with were Python and Java. I mean, I've heard about C and C++ before, but I didn't really know that it was a
programming language. After awhile, I've gotten more familiar w/ C, C++, and C# due to hearing it often, but then I never really knew what
are the differences between each programming languages up until this moment. I find this article explains about the traits of each languages
and point out the differences in a comprehensive & easy-to-understand manner. TL:DR; C++ is an extended version of C, meanwhile C# is more like
java due to its object-oriented language trait.

2. [C Tutorial by tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)<br>
A step-by-step C language tutorial by tutorialspoint. Providing an easy-to-follow tutorial starting from setting up the environment for C and other
topics such as data types, arrays, functions, loops, etc. Each step of this tutorial is formatted with first describing about each topic,
and then giving some examples/lines of code concerning the topic.

3. [w3school's tutorial on C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)<br>
A quick trivia, w3school is one of the websites that helped me a lot on my CS journey. It provides tutorial on Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
Django, etc. So when looking for C tutorial, my keywords on Google were "c tutorial w3school". But there was no result on w3school's C tutorial. Instead,
I found this C++ tutorial from w3school. Since C++ is an 'extended version' of C, and C syntaxes would still run on C++, so I decided to keep this on
this week's top ten.
