# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Understanding the Differences Between C#, C++, and C](https://csharp-station.com/understanding-the-differences-between-c-c-and-c/)<br>
Back in my first semester, I was a freshman with no pre-knowledge whatsoever on programming and/or programming languages. The only programming
languages I was familiar with were Python and Java. I mean, I've heard about C and C++ before, but I didn't really know that it was a
programming language. After awhile, I've gotten more familiar w/ C, C++, and C# due to hearing it often, but then I never really knew what
are the differences between each programming languages up until this moment. I find this article explains about the traits of each languages
and point out the differences in a comprehensive & easy-to-understand manner. TL:DR; C++ is an extended version of C, meanwhile C# is more like
java due to its object-oriented language trait.

2. [C Tutorial by tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)<br>
A step-by-step C language tutorial by tutorialspoint. Providing an easy-to-follow tutorial starting from setting up the environment for C and other
topics such as data types, arrays, functions, loops, etc. Each step of this tutorial is formatted with first describing about each topic,
and then giving some examples/lines of code concerning the topic.

3. [w3school's tutorial on C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)<br>
A quick trivia, w3school is one of the websites that helped me a lot on my CS journey. It provides tutorial on Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
Django, etc. So when looking for C tutorial, my keywords on Google were "c tutorial w3school". But there was no result on w3school's C tutorial. Instead,
I found this C++ tutorial from w3school. Since C++ is an 'extended version' of C, and C syntaxes would still run on C++, so I decided to keep this on
this week's top ten.

4. [(almost) 4-hours introductory C tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0)<br>
Don't have the time to try out all of the steps on w3school/tutorialpoints' C tutorial? well now, this is basically the previous step-by-step tutorial from
w3school/tutorialspoint, but in the form of video with someone narrating and demo-ing each step of the tutorial. Yes, 3 hours 46 minutes still isn't a short
time to spend, especially knowing that the workloads of PJJ's academic left us with very little time to "Try this, Try that", this video will certainly helps
since it provides the timestamps of the material on the description. Makes it easier to jump right into the intended material.

5. [Understanding Linux file permission](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-linux-file-permissions/)<br>
Another quick trivia, the very first week after I installed Linux, I encountered a bit trouble on how to mount my NTFS D: drive automatically
everytime I boot on my Linux. My intention was to make the D: drive as a shared partition for both my Windows & Linux system, since it has a relatively big
capacity (1.5-ish TB). But then the trouble was I couldn't change/create/delete files on my D:, with the error msg saying "you don't have permission to make
changes in this drive" or something like that. TL:DR, the problem enabled me to learn one or two things about Linux's file permission mechanism.

6. [Examples of managing file permission on linux](https://www.comentum.com/unix-osx-permissions.html#:~:text=FIle%20type%3A%20%22%20%2D%20%22%20means,the%20owner%20of%20the%20file)<br>
At the number 5 description, I only wrote my experience with linux file permission and didn't exactly describe about the given page. So, my number 5 for
this week's top ten is an article that explains the concept of Linux's file permission. Meanwhile, my number 6 for this week is a set of examples or
hands-on tutorial of Linux's file permission concept explained in the number 5's article.

7. [What is a filesystem and why are there so many of them](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/htg-explains-what-is-a-file-system-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them/)<br>
This is an article from howtogeek, explaining about what is filesystem and why are there so many of them. The article also explains a short bit about
some of the most common file systems available, such as FAT32, NTFS, exFAT, ext, etc.

8. [Pros and cons of partitioning your hard drive](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/partition-hard-drive-explained/)<br>
I have been exposed to computer machine (desktop/laptop) probably since I was 5, and i've been using only Windows until just recently (I just installed Linux
right before this semester started), so the only partition I knew was Local Disk C: and Local Disk D:. Until recently, I just installed Linux, in which the installation
required me to add new partitition. From that case, this article helps me to know what are the drawbacks of partitioning and what to expect from it.

9. [What is swap partition on Linux?](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/swap-partition/)<br>
The first time I heard swap was when installing Linux. Back then, I didn't really knew what swap was. But it turns out swap has a very interesting purpose. Knowing
that swap can be used as a 'subtitute' or 'addition' for RAM, is an aha! moment for me. This article provides more explanation about swap partition on Linux.

10. [Choosing the best partition scheme for your Linux system](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35676/how-to-choose-a-partition-scheme-for-your-linux-pc/)<br>
This article starts from explaining what is a partition, and then proceeds to give a tutorial on what is the best practice on partitioning one's hard drive.
TL:DR, the most common scheme being used on Linux is to split the drive into three partition: /root, /swap, and /home
