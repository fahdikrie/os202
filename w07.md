# Top 10 List of Week 07



1. [Process Synchronization: Critical Section Problem in OS](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html) <br>
Quoting from the source: *"Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources."*


2. [Introduction of Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/) <br>
Another reading material for this week's topic


3. [Multithreading in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-c-2/) <br>
This week's topic is highly correlated with last week's (duh). I didn't really understand about how last week's tarball worked, the thread/fork process behind it so I struggled a bit w/ this week's tarball assignment.


4. [Mutex lock for Linux Thread Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-lock-for-linux-thread-synchronization/) <br>
Hey, I can't be the only one who says "mutex teh naoonnn" pas ngeliat mutex pertama kali


5. [How to use POSIX semaphores in C language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-posix-semaphores-c/) <br>
Quoting from the source *"Semaphores are very useful in process synchronization and multithreading. But how to use one in real life, for example say in C Language?"*. Bro the only semaphore I know in real life is the one from boy scout ðŸ˜‚


6. [Difference between wait() and sleep()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/difference-between-wait-and-sleep) <br>
A glimpse of highlight from the source: *"A wait can be "woken up" by another thread calling notify on the monitor which is being waited on whereas a sleep cannot"*. You learn new things everyday hehe


7. [Difference between getc(), getchar(), getch() and getche()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-getchar-getch-getc-getche/?ref=lbp) <br>
Stumbled upon this as a recommendation while reading an article on this week's topic. Man this C language sure is hard to figure


8. [Arm processors: Everything you need to know](https://www.zdnet.com/article/introducing-the-arm-processor-again-what-you-should-know-about-it-now/) <br>
In light of the recent apple silicon/macbook M1 situation.


9. [Key differences between ARM & x86 architecture](https://www.androidauthority.com/arm-vs-x86-key-differences-explained-568718/) <br>
GSGS'ing this out of my own sheer curiosity.


10. [About the Rosetta Translation Environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment) <br>
Documentation from apple for developers on their cutting edge rosetta 2 technology.
